<title>Bike Grid Now - Call Tom</title>
<h2>Alderman Tom Tunney's Phone Number: <a href="tel:773-525-6034">773-525-6034</a></h2> </br>
<h2>Hi, my name is [your name] and I recently attended a bike ride for safe streets in the 44th Ward hosted by Bike Grid Now and Chicago Family Biking.  Bicycle and pedestrian safety is an important issue, especially since 3 people have been killed in traffic crashes since 2018 in this ward alone.  Iâ€™m calling on Alderman Tunney to firmly support investments in safe streets, such as a bike grid on 10% of city streets, physical safety measures at intersections and streets around schools & parks, and lowering neighborhood speed limits to 10 MPH. Limited bike parking is something that stands out in Lakeview East, especially around our schools, like Nettlehorst. Biking could be the most equitable, sustainable, and healthy way to get around Chicago, but our neighborhood is not safe from traffic violence. Our children, seniors, and residents need safe, comfortable places to walk & bike, and we need Alderman Tunney to make this happen in Lakeview now!  Thank you.</h2>
